## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to complete all sub-projects?
**A**: No! Each sub-project builds on the previous one, but you can stop at any point. For example:
- Stop at Sub-Project 1 for a basic web app
- Stop at Sub-Project 2 for AI-enhanced version
- Stop at Sub-Project 3 for a deployed PWA
- Complete all 4 for full experience
- Currently, sub-project 3 and 4 are not yet confirmed.

**Good luck with your PickPassword project!** ðŸš€
